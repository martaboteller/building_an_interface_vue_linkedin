## About the project

I've followed this LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/vue-js-building-an-interface-2?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5d94ce0a498e93731fbb8711">course</a> offered by Ray Villalobos.
It teaches how to build a simple component-based app: an appointment booking and management system with features for searching and sorting.
<br/>
Ray Villalobos shows how to use Vue.js components and subcomponents; build forms; create, update, and delete data; and manage events.

I am on my way to achieve a :rocket: fullstack overview!
